        <h2><u style="text-decoration-color:brown;">Health Care</u></h2>
        <p>India has made rapid strides in the health sector since independence. However, various eye opening data from NFHS clearly indicate that access to healthcare still remains a challenge.While the health statistics of rural India continue to be poor, the health status and access to health for the poor in urban slum dwellers has surfaced to be equally deplorable and have less than 4% of government primary healthcare facilities.<br><br><br>

        Urban slum dwellers suffer from adverse health conditions owing to mainly two reasons –first the lack of education and thus lack of awareness; and second the unwillingness to lose a day’s wage in order to reach the nearest medical facility. Healthcare for underprivileged, which is a desperate need, thus remains unaddressed.
        The need of the hour is thus a two pronged approach – first to bring quality healthcare services to doorsteps of the needy and second to promote healthcare awareness and contemporary healthcare seeking behavior among the underprivileged.</p>

        <h2><u style="text-decoration-color:brown;">Women Empowerment</u></h2>
        <p>Various studies,have shown that when we work towards women empowerment, the whole society benefits. But unfortunately in India, far from empowering women, most are denied even their basic rights like health, education of girls for women empowerment, employment and a respectable status in society.Swabhiman, meaning self-respect in English, was initiated in 2005 to address these challenges through a simple yet effective approach.<br><br><br>

        The programme is specifically aimed at realization of both individual and collective self-esteem and inner strength for marginalised and socially excluded women and adolescent girls through innovative community practices.
        A tailor-made strategy called the '4 S Model' has been developed under Swabhiman, the women empowerment programme. The ‘4 S Model’ is an acronym for four novel approaches, namely Seeking Healthcare as a Behaviour, Support for Education, Supporters through Male Involvement, and Sustaining the Change in Communities.</p>
